# Dictionary

# Next Release
the next version will have a very less amount of code ( i noticed the mistake while i was uploading, bruh :-3 )

# What's special?
to be honest, i have never met a offline dictionary in which if we enter a wrong word ( wrong spelllings ), it will say that there are no results for the word we searched, but this simple program is an exception to it :)
